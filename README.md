# Stock-Price-Prediction-Project


### Intensive Communications and Information Technology (3 months) and under the supervision National Telecommunication Institute (NTI), Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) in Egypt
### Track Big Data Science

### Stock Price Prediction by Algorithms Trading


### Project Objective

Stock price prediction by trading algo. is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield a significant profit( ). we need to  forecast the stock price for days that we determined  so, we used  time series analysis and forecasting to predict the returns on a stock for that days (i.e., predict future data points (returns) in a time of days).   



### Problems

Markets are complex systems and chaotic systems with complex dynamics, yet to a certain extent we can make valid stock market forecasts. Using these forecasts generated by cutting-edge predictive algorithms together with a careful risk management strategy may give a trader a significant competitive advantage.
